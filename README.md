🍳 Recipe Preparation Agent
📌 Overview

The Recipe Preparation Agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users cook meals using only the ingredients they have on hand. By leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the system retrieves relevant recipes and generates step-by-step instructions tailored to ingredient availability. It also provides substitutions, cooking tips, and dietary adjustments, making everyday cooking smarter, simpler, and more sustainable.
